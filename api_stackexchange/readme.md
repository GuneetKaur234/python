# Stack exchange API

## A fully functional simple project written in Python showing how to use Requests.

- In this project I have imported Requests module, This allows you to send HTTP requests using Python.
- The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).
- I have further used get method to make request to Stack Exchange web page by using API key.
- Then For loop is used to fetch content from web page and print them.
