# News API

## A fully functional project written in Python.

- In this project I have imported modules such as requests and json.
- Requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python.
- The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).
- I have further used get method to make request to newsapi web page by using API key.
- Then For loop is used to fetch content from web page and print them.
  
## How to use this example

1. Clone this project
2. Download all the mentioned modules, using comand "python -m pip install module_name"
